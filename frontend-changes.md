# Frontend Changes - Theme Toggle Button & Light Theme

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive theme system with a toggle button that allows users to switch between dark and light themes. The toggle is positioned in the top-right corner of the header with smooth animations and full accessibility support. Enhanced the light theme with proper contrast ratios and WCAG accessibility compliance.
